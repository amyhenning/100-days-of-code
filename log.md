# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 61: March 19, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Got a high-level approach to the cash register algorithm written out.
- Drafted my second blog post about my job search.

**Thoughts:**
- Not going to lie, the cash register algorithm is a little bit intimidating. I focused on breaking up the problem into chunks and writing high-level logic that I'm sure I'll refactor at some point. For now, it's helpful to have some thoughts in my code editor.

### Day 60: March 18, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Finished the telephone number checker algorithm and got started on the cash register algorithm. I'm SO close to finishing the JS algorithms and data structures track on FreeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts:**
- I used the handwritten notes I took on regex earlier this year in solving the telephone number algorithm. I needed a few hints to get the regex looking right and now see how my code wasn't specific enough to catch some of the edge case tests.

### Day 59: March 15, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
- Finished editing my first blog post about my job search.
- Worked on a little big of an algorithm, just to keep my brain engaged with actual code.

**Thoughts:**
- The blog post was very much less widely-read than anticipated. I have no idea how to manage social media stuff like this, so it'll be a bit of trial and error from here on out to make things more engaging and eye-catching.

### Day 58: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on the next JS algorithms project on FreeCodeCamp
- Drafted my first blog post on my post-graduation job search

**Thoughts:**
- I write a lot. I'm an English major and never really learned how not to be verbose. I feel like I need to do better at editing/outlining my blog posts for readability's sake.

**Link to Work:**
1. None today

### Day 57: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Solved a couple more JS algorithms and started outlining topics for my blog posts about job searching as a bootcamp graduate!

**Thoughts:**
- Blog posts are hard. It's hard to put your experience and opinions out there! I have had a bit of writer's block but these outlines should help me move forward again.

### Day 56: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Solved some JS algorithms. I had a lot of fun with the orbital period challenge. Reminded me of why I loved math as a kid!

**Thoughts:**
- I suffer a lot from imposter syndrome when it comes to CS concepts and advanced math. I did well in math all through high school and took all the AP calculus classes that were available at the time and got 5s on both of them. Somehow, when I went to college and didn't have any geneds (thanks, Grinnell), I decided to shy away from math and science and read books and learn about languages. Those aren't bad, but I do think that I avoided math and science out of a deep fear of failure when confronted with the rigor of coursework at Grinnell. Also, I took a calculus-based stats class that I had no business or interest in being in. :| The choices of 18 and 19-year-old me are puzzling.

### Day 55: March 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Populated content onto my site's portfolio section, and did a little bit of thinking on some JS algorithms.

**Thoughts:**
- I was a bit distracted because I found out I received an Opportunity Scholarship to attend RailsConf this year! Hoping I can make it work with tne new job.

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 54: March 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- FINALLY got the portfolio page of my personal site to a place where I feel good about the responsiveness/media queries.
- Started adding actual content (app screenshots + titles) to the portfolio page.

**Thoughts:**
- It has been really helpful for my progress to focus on one aspect of the site at a time. I'm nearly done with the portfolio piece, so I'll have to decide what's next (possibly the nav - it's bothering me at small screen sizes :|).

**Link to Work:**
1. You can see a gif of the responsive design at [this tweet](https://twitter.com/henningamy/status/1103528846463197184)!

### Day 53: March 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed a JS algorithm on FreeCodeCamp
- Dug into the minutiae of margins on my personal site

**Thoughts:**
- I am still finding it hard to balance solving coding challenges/algorithms and working on projects.
- Not having touched a JS algorithm for several days meant today was a rather rude awakening!

**Link to Work:**
1. None yet!

### Day 52: March 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Today I made a conscious decision to focus only on the portfolio page of my site.
- Mocked up layouts for displaying projects I've created, and created a couple different options for how I'll eventually list out skills / tools used for each project.

**Thoughts:**
- After a few days of indecision, I just decided to go for it. I copied a fellow 100-days-of-coder's approach to mocking up her site to get the layout set up before adding content, and that has helped a lot!

**Link to Work:**
1. None yet!

### Day 51: March 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Spent a lot of time agonizing over navbar styles and media queries for it.

**Thoughts:**
- See yesterdday's thoughts!

**Link to Work:**
1. None yet!

### Day 50: March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Small adjustments to personal website.

**Thoughts:**
- Small changes are hard to keep track of! I also am worried that I'll never be fully satisfied with my site. :|

**Link to Work:**
1. None yet!

### Day 49: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- More styles for my site!

**Thoughts:**
- Design work slows me down so much. It's so hard to make decisions on how I want things to look!

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 48: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Skipped coding on the 26th because of migraine. :(
- Worked on some styles for my personal site.

**Thoughts:**
- It is really hard to focus on code when I'm feeling sick/have a headache. Blah.

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 47: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on debugging some Angular tests!

**Thoughts:**
- Slowing down to articulate my thoughts/understanding of code out loud is a very helpful exercise.

**Link to Work:**
1. Nothing really to link from this day's work!

### Day 46: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Spent several hours reviewing concepts in preparation for a technical interview.
- Lots of review of CSS terms, JavaScript concepts, and data structures. Oh, also the HTTP request cycle for Rails apps.
- Wrote some code to iteratively and recursively find the length of a singly-linked list. This all made SO much more sense to me than during my bootcamp.

**Thoughts:**
- I really enjoyed this prep work. I got to nerd out and learn some new things while also solidifying and reviewing other concepts!
- I had the beginnings of a migraine while working on this, which made my eyesight a little blurry. I'm attributing this to stress.

**Link to Work:**
1. Nothing really to share from this day.

### Days 44 and 45: February 21 and 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on my personal site - namely, on styling. Flexbox makes me happy.

**Thoughts:**
- It's hard not to be paralyzed by perfectionism with design! 

**Link to Work:**
1. None yet!

### Day 43: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on personal site - particularly focused on essential style elements based on wireframes and my vision for how the site will look eventually

**Thoughts:**
- It's been a lot of fun to get back to some front-end work and to practice working with Jekyll again!
- I need to figure out how to put an "under construction" message on my site for now... Something to work on tomorrow!

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 42: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on JS algorithms!

**Thoughts:**
- Algorithms are great but I am feeling a need to get back to some creative work.

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 41: February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Solved an algorithm on FreeCodeCamp to warm up
- Wrote drafts of a few blog posts to finish up a series on OOP basics I started a LONG time ago...

**Thoughts:**
- Writing the blog posts and creating code snippets to illustrate concepts was a great review of OOP principles.
- I've been using Evernote as a way to house my draft blog posts. I'd like to get ahead of myself and have several drafts essentially ready to publish so I become a more regular blogger.
- I also needed to move past some perfectionism in getting these drafts ready - ideally, I'd want my personal site to be up and running, but I am going to post them to Medium in the meantime and then back-date them on my site once it's ready.

### Days 34 - 40: February 11-17

**Today's Progress:**
- This is actually about a week's worth of updates, but it'll be brief. I took a small hiatus from checking Twitter constantly (something I've started doing since beginning this challenge), and it was wonderful for clearing my mind. I spent this week primarily working on my first project with an Angular front-end and a Rails back-end and also made good progress in the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section of FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms certification.

**Thoughts:**
- Like I wrote above, taking a break from tracking everything and instead focusing on the code was a good change of pace for me this week.
- Diving into an existing Angular/Rails application and adding features was more complex than I thought. I think I did alright for it being my first time working with Angular, though.
- I have a blog post waiting to be written and don't want to wait till I have my personal site up and running, so I'll probably write that up on Medium this week and add it to my site later.

### Day 33: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Added custom fonts to personal site, made some small structural changes, and continued ideation for layouts and color schemes

**Thoughts:**
- Taking a bit of a break from coding incessantly this weekend was a good thing for my brain and mood.

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 32: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Spent a lot of time wireframing and previewing color schemes for personal site

**Thoughts:**
- Wireframing is interesting as an exercise in how well I know things like CSS flexbox - I try to envision the code I'd need while creating the draft visuals

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 31: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp
- Bought domain name!
- Created the initial skeleton for a site built with Jekyll following the tutorial on their site.

**Thoughts:**
- Today I decided to work on the more time-sensitive things (i.e., my desired domain name could get taken and I'd like to update my personal site ASAP) to get moving. I may not focus purely on this project over the next several weeks but it's a start!

2. [Started very basic skeleton of Jekyll site](https://github.com/amyhenning/amyhenning.io)

### Day 30: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- More algorithms.

**Thoughts:**
- I'm getting stuck in this pattern of doing algorithms because I'm indecisive about starting a blog vs. redesigning my portfolio vs. continuing to extend and improve personal projects. My list of things I want to do is so long that I am kind of in a state of paralysis.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Solutions to some Functional Programming JS exercises here](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)

### Day 29: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- More algorithms!

**Thoughts:**
- I'd like to get into a less linear approach to programming - not solely focusing on a project or coding challenges, but doing a bit of both each day.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Solutions to some Functional Programming JS exercises here](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)

### Day 28: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed some algorithms on FreeCodeCamp in JS.

**Thoughts:**
- I am enjoying the MDN docs very much. I wish Ruby's were as easy to parse quickly.
- I dreamed about Rspec tests and JS `for` loops last night, so I must be doing _something_ right.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Solutions to some Functional Programming JS exercises here](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)

### Day 27: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Functional Programming on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Learning JS has become much more fun over time. Taking notes always, always helps me absorb new things better.
- I am puzzled by currying and partial application. Will revisit or look for more resources on these two soon.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Solutions to some Functional Programming JS exercises here](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)

### Day 26: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Began the Functional Programming section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- JS is sometimes still very confusing. I still feel like I'm constantly learning new things about it but it helps to think about how the things I learn compare to features of Ruby.

**Link to Work:**
1. Nothing today.

### Day 25: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- After a discouraging day yesterday, I went ahead and tried out restructuring some things (per the model in [this blog post](https://www.topdan.com/ruby-on-rails/ajax-toggle-buttons.html)) to get jQuery favorites to work.
- IT WORKS NOW!
- Also finished the OOP section on FreeCodeCamp for an easy win to warm up before working on the favorites.

**Thoughts:**
- The feature working is even better because it was difficult to implement. I learned a lot while working on this, too.
- Perhaps I'll next give this a shot with reviews.

**Link to Work:**
1. [See the bookmark feature live!](http://kad-library.herokuapp.com)

### Day 24: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Lots of trial and error with adding jQuery to existing app.

**Thoughts:**
- It's definitely tough to implement a new feature in an existing codebase. :|
- Today was more frustrating than most recent days, but I hope that sleeping on it helps.

**Link to Work:**
Nothing new or notable to share today.

### Day 23: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Began implementing bookmarking buttons on KAD-Library using jQuery!

**Thoughts:**
- It was very easy to put this off for a while since jQuery intimidates me. However, I am finding that the more I work with it, the more I feel comfortable (same as anything else, really).
- The blocker I'm stuck on now is how to efficiently get bookmark IDs and use them to create unique id tags for favorites to be used by jQuery. This may require some restructuring of how resources are displayed on the site.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Very incomplete progress on KAD-Library](https://github.com/amyhenning/kad-library/commit/b9d48c56beb8e3e92005c512f3d515f178d13dbc)

### Day 22: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on some Ruby kata on CodeWars
- Researched more and experimented a bit with using jQuery and ajax calls to delete records in my Kittens! app from a while ago - practice for implementing this on KAD-Library for bookmarking/unbookmarking resources

**Thoughts:**
- I get nervous about making a big change to a more complex app and sort of just don't want to start. Trying out some things and successfully debugging issues with my jQuery on a simpler app was confidence-boosting and good practice.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Updated Kittens!](https://github.com/amyhenning/odin-kittens)

### Day 21: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed a Codewars challenge in Ruby
- Did some more research on (potentially) using jQuery to implement the improved bookmark functionality on my personal project.

**Thoughts:**
- Coding later in the day meant that my commit streak on Github is broken due to the UTC timestamps. :( The blank space is going to bother me.
- Taking a step back and looking at AJAX calls in Rails with some resources made the prospect of implementing it a bit less scary than yesterday.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Simple Transposition](https://github.com/amyhenning/coding-challenges/blob/master/simple_transposition.rb)

### Day 20: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting section on FreeCodeCamp!
- Made a small step toward improving the user experience on my personal project and started documenting my progress for a future blog post.

**Thoughts:**
- I feel much more at home with ES6 syntax now.
- The prospect of using jQuery for my personal project (it's one option I'm considering moving forward with) is frightening. I struggled with jQuery the most in my bootcamp, so I know it'll be good practice but... I also just don't like it. More exploration on that to come tomorrow, though.

**Link to Work:**
1. [JavaScript challenges (some were completed for my bootcamp, some on FCC)](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)


### Day 19: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Basic Data Structures and started Basic Algorithm Scripting on FreeCodeCamp
- Returned to a personal project I haven't worked on in a while. My goal for improving the project is to smooth out the user experience with adding bookmarks - I'd ideally like to learn enough to eliminate page refreshes altogether when a user adds or removes a bookmark using a button.

**Thoughts:**
- JS syntax is making a lot more sense to me - I appreciate how the Data Structures and Basic Algorithms sections on FreeCodeCamp build off of one another in order to support more independence in students.
- Going back to an old project is a rude awakening - I forgot a lot about what I wrote a while back, so I've had to refamiliarize myself with the code while also researching how to improve it.

**Link to Work:**
1. [JavaScript challenges (some were completed for my bootcamp, some on FCC)](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)


### Day 18: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Basic Data Structures on FreeCodeCamp and started working through the Basic Algorithm Scripting section.

**Thoughts:**
- The Basic Data Structures section helped me take a step back and think about looking at JSON  differently, while also helping me see how concepts I'm familiar with in Ruby are applied in JavaScript
- The Basic Algorithm Scripting section contains challenges I've completed in both JS and Ruby, so it was just some good review and practice with JS syntax.

**Link to Work:**
1. [JavaScript challenges (some were completed for my bootcamp, some today)](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)

### Day 17: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked through several debugging JS lessons on FreeCodeCamp.
- It had been a while since I'd done any Ruby coding challenges, so I did a couple from Codewars.

**Thoughts:**
- I really need to make Ruby challenges a standard part of my daily routine - both to keep my Ruby skills sharp and maybe even apply some things I just learned, like regular expressions.

2. [Multiplication Table Solution](https://github.com/amyhenning/coding-challenges/blob/master/multiplication_table.rb)

### Day 16: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Practiced a bunch with regular expressions: redid the FreeCodeCamp exercises and took notes this time, then began interactive lessons on regexone.com

**Thoughts:**
- I really do need to take notes more often - this helped a lot with remembering regex syntax.

**Link to Work:**
1. None for today!

### Day 15: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Refactored flickr-stream partial to use image_tags in link_to tags.
- Completed lots of JS exercises (ES6 and regex) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**
- I am looking forward to getting used to JS's syntax. Right now, it still hurts my eyes.
- Regular expressions are still largely inscrutable to me. I am planning to redo the regex section on FreeCodeCamp and take careful, color-coded notes by hand. Maybe after that I'll study up on regex syntax in Ruby and make a comparison guide to really solidify the concepts and syntax in both languages.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Practice with ES6 arrow functions](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript/blob/master/squaredIntegers.js)

### Day 14: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Took some strategic steps to figure out how to handle errors from the Flickr API on my flickr-stream app. First, figured out how to render a json error if the API returned "user not found." Then moved on to separating the views into partials to render based on the API's response.

**Thoughts:**
- Lots of Googling and learning from how others have structured similar apps today.
- Building this app was great practice doing a self-guided project with unfamiliar territory: Flickr's API, handling errors, and practicing with partial views.

2. [flickr-stream live site](https://flickr-stream-amy-henning.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 13: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Used the magic of irb to test FlickRaw responses and determine how to get the params I wanted to use in the Flickr Stream app's views.

**Thoughts:**
- Spending some time thinking through this through the lens of writing the API client helped me figure out what I wanted to do and how to get the information I needed.
- Up next is adding error messages when a user doesn't exist.

**Link to Work:**
1. [flickr-stream so far](https://github.com/amyhenning/flickr-stream)

### Day 12: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Realized my dates from the last two logs were wrong. Woops. Fixed that.
- Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to use the Flickraw gem in my flickr-stream project. As of now, it seems to be working to return photos from the Flickr API, but I still need to figure out how to get different properties of each photo, such as its URL.

**Thoughts:**
- For some reason, I had a hard time understanding the documentation for the Flickraw gem - this made my progress slower than anticipated today.
- More Ruby exercises needed in the future.

**Link to Work:**
1. [flickr-stream so far](https://github.com/amyhenning/flickr-stream)

### Day 11: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished all Basic JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
- Made some small progress on my flickr-stream app.

**Thoughts:**
- JavaScript makes me yearn for the simplicity of Ruby syntax!
- I enjoyed learning about switch statements a lot, and the Basic JS exercises were a good refresh and a good intro to several things that my bootcamp didn't cover and that I've never encountered in my own projects.
- I need to spend more time solving algorithms!

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 10: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed many simple JS exercises on FreeCodeCamp to get a firmer grasp on its formatting
- Started another more complex Rails API project via the Odin Project

**Thoughts:**
- It's not that I can't or don't want to learn JavaScript... I just am less exposed to it than other languages. I also far prefer Ruby's clean formatting. However, I recognize the incredible value of JS and am determined to get a better grasp on it.
- Considering making the new API project more complex than written in The Odin Project's lesson by not using a Gem. We'll see how that goes.

**Link to Work:**
- None today!

### Day 9: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Re-read the "APIs and Building Your Own" section of The Odin Project.
- Finished the simple RESTful API I started yesterday.

**Thoughts:**
- APIs are making a lot more sense now! Spending time reading about and working with them in various forms has been super helpful for my learning.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Live Kittens! Site](http://kittens-amy-henning.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 8: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started the "APIs and Building Your Own" section of The Odin Project.
- Created initial structure for the simple Kittens RESTful API in the curriculum.

**Thoughts:**
- I'm enjoying the write-ups from the Odin Project's curriculum so far. It's interesting to delve into new curricula and pick and choose what I'm looking for, and this one is structured in such a way that that's both possible and easy.
- I'm excited to learn from this project but also want to revisit yesterday's simple gem to see if I can expand its functionality without the tutorial.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Kittens!](https://github.com/amyhenning/odin-kittens)

### Day 7: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Spent a _long_ time searching for a good, simple tutorial on creating an API client that wasn't just a simple Rails CRUD app.
- Found some great resources on GoRails.com!
- Followed [this tutorial](https://gorails.com/episodes/consuming-an-api-using-httparty-and-creating-a-gem) to build a simple Ruby Gem to interact with [Animatedgif.me](http://animatedgif.me)

**Thoughts:**
- The video tutorial was well-explained and concise. I had to do some debugging that I assume had something to do with the tutorial being over 4 years old, but all worked out fine in the end and the debugging was a good learning exercise, anyway.
- I can now say that I've created a simple Ruby gem. :)
- Still on the hunt for a good tutorial that walks you through creating an API client with authentication, though.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Animatedgifme Gem](https://github.com/amyhenning/animatedgifme)

### Day 6: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Continued working on backend Rails project.

**Thoughts:**
- There's a lot I don't know, and even more that I don't know I don't know. While I thought building a simple API from scratch would be no problem, it's proving very challenging because I haven't built one with any guidance before. I want to improve at this, and I learn best by doing, so I may create one following a tutorial first, then move toward building my own after I understand a basic structure and approach.

### Day 5: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started and finished a quick portfolio page using flexbox. Didn't add in all the content I would have wanted, but the process gave me some design ideas for updating my existing portfolio site.

**Thoughts:**
- Simple design projects like this one are going faster with more and more practice. It's great to know that I'm solidifying and improving existing skills!

**Link to Work:**
1. [Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/amyhenning/pen/jXQdqv)

### Day 4: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started working on a backend Rails project.
- Solved a coding challenge to turn a string of numbers into an integer without using Ruby's `to_i` method.

**Thoughts:**
- Feel like I'm stumbling around in the dark with the Rails project, which is a definite change from the front-end work I've been doing lately. But it's a great challenge and I love learning about the logic of backend things and want to learn more about creating API clients.
- I need to dig deeper into the `inject`/`reduce` methods in Ruby. I have found them quite useful in the past but still don't fully understand how they work.

### Day 3: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started and finished a responsive technical documentation page project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Before I started on this, the finished product looked more complicated than it actually turned out to be. Yay for learning!
- Using some of the RuboCop Ruby Style Guide to populate content for this product was also a learning experience for me in some Ruby styling conventions.

### Day 2: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Double-checked that projects from yesterday were passing all tests, and made some small adjustments to get them there
- Started and finished the product landing page project from FreeCodeCamp (made it into a mockup for the front-end of a future project I'm planning on working on)

**Thoughts:**
- Getting more and more practice with flexbox and media queries has been great.
- While I've known how to work with CSS since high school, going through these exercises is helping it seem less overwhelming and helping me organize my code more efficiently.

### Day 1: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed the simple tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp
- Completed survey form project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Both these projects were in essence very simple tasks, yet they were an opportunity to apply some concepts I've picked up through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum - including accessibility and flexbox.
- Both projects were great in pushing me to move away from depending on Bootstrap to make design responsive!
