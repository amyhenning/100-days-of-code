# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed the simple tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp
- Completed survey form project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** 
- Both these projects were in essence very simple tasks, yet they were an opportunity to apply some concepts I've picked up through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum - including accessibility and flexbox.
- Both projects were great in pushing me to move away from depending on Bootstrap to make design responsive!
