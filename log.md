# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started the "APIs and Building Your Own" section of The Odin Project.
- Created initial structure for the simple Kittens RESTful API in the curriculum.

**Thoughts:**
- I'm enjoying the write-ups from the Odin Project's curriculum so far. It's interesting to delve into new curricula and pick and choose what I'm looking for, and this one is structured in such a way that that's both possible and easy.
- I'm excited to learn from this project but also want to revisit yesterday's simple gem to see if I can expand its functionality without the tutorial.

### Day 7: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Spent a _long_ time searching for a good, simple tutorial on creating an API client that wasn't just a simple Rails CRUD app.
- Found some great resources on GoRails.com!
- Followed [this tutorial](https://gorails.com/episodes/consuming-an-api-using-httparty-and-creating-a-gem) to build a simple Ruby Gem to interact with [Animatedgif.me](http://animatedgif.me)

**Thoughts:**
- The video tutorial was well-explained and concise. I had to do some debugging that I assume had something to do with the tutorial being over 4 years old, but all worked out fine in the end and the debugging was a good learning exercise, anyway.
- I can now say that I've created a simple Ruby gem. :)
- Still on the hunt for a good tutorial that walks you through creating an API client with authentication, though.

### Day 6: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Continued working on backend Rails project.

**Thoughts:**
- There's a lot I don't know, and even more that I don't know I don't know. While I thought building a simple API from scratch would be no problem, it's proving very challenging because I haven't built one with any guidance before. I want to improve at this, and I learn best by doing, so I may create one following a tutorial first, then move toward building my own after I understand a basic structure and approach.

### Day 5: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started and finished a quick portfolio page using flexbox. Didn't add in all the content I would have wanted, but the process gave me some design ideas for updating my existing portfolio site.

**Thoughts:**
- Simple design projects like this one are going faster with more and more practice. It's great to know that I'm solidifying and improving existing skills!

### Day 4: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started working on a backend Rails project.
- Solved a coding challenge to turn a string of numbers into an integer without using Ruby's `to_i` method.

**Thoughts:**
- Feel like I'm stumbling around in the dark with the Rails project, which is a definite change from the front-end work I've been doing lately. But it's a great challenge and I love learning about the logic of backend things and want to learn more about creating API clients.
- I need to dig deeper into the `inject`/`reduce` methods in Ruby. I have found them quite useful in the past but still don't fully understand how they work.

### Day 3: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started and finished a responsive technical documentation page project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Before I started on this, the finished product looked more complicated than it actually turned out to be. Yay for learning!
- Using some of the RuboCop Ruby Style Guide to populate content for this product was also a learning experience for me in some Ruby styling conventions.

### Day 2: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Double-checked that projects from yesterday were passing all tests, and made some small adjustments to get them there
- Started and finished the product landing page project from FreeCodeCamp (made it into a mockup for the front-end of a future project I'm planning on working on)

**Thoughts:**
- Getting more and more practice with flexbox and media queries has been great.
- While I've known how to work with CSS since high school, going through these exercises is helping it seem less overwhelming and helping me organize my code more efficiently.

### Day 1: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed the simple tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp
- Completed survey form project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Both these projects were in essence very simple tasks, yet they were an opportunity to apply some concepts I've picked up through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum - including accessibility and flexbox.
- Both projects were great in pushing me to move away from depending on Bootstrap to make design responsive!
