# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed the simple tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp
- Started survey form project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** 
- This was in essence a very simple task, yet it was an opportunity to apply some concepts I've picked up through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum - including accessibility and flexbox.
