# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 27: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Functional Programming on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Learning JS has become much more fun over time. Taking notes always, always helps me absorb new things better.
- I am puzzled by currying and partial application. Will revisit or look for more resources on these two soon.

### Day 26: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Began the Functional Programming section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- JS is sometimes still very confusing. I still feel like I'm constantly learning new things about it but it helps to think about how the things I learn compare to features of Ruby.

1. Nothing today.

### Day 25: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- After a discouraging day yesterday, I went ahead and tried out restructuring some things (per the model in [this blog post](https://www.topdan.com/ruby-on-rails/ajax-toggle-buttons.html)) to get jQuery favorites to work.
- IT WORKS NOW!
- Also finished the OOP section on FreeCodeCamp for an easy win to warm up before working on the favorites.

**Thoughts:**
- The feature working is even better because it was difficult to implement. I learned a lot while working on this, too.
- Perhaps I'll next give this a shot with reviews.

### Day 24: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Lots of trial and error with adding jQuery to existing app.

**Thoughts:**
- It's definitely tough to implement a new feature in an existing codebase. :|
- Today was more frustrating than most recent days, but I hope that sleeping on it helps.

**Link to Work:**
Nothing new or notable to share today.

### Day 23: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Began implementing bookmarking buttons on KAD-Library using jQuery!

**Thoughts:**
- It was very easy to put this off for a while since jQuery intimidates me. However, I am finding that the more I work with it, the more I feel comfortable (same as anything else, really).
- The blocker I'm stuck on now is how to efficiently get bookmark IDs and use them to create unique id tags for favorites to be used by jQuery. This may require some restructuring of how resources are displayed on the site.

### Day 22: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked on some Ruby kata on CodeWars
- Researched more and experimented a bit with using jQuery and ajax calls to delete records in my Kittens! app from a while ago - practice for implementing this on KAD-Library for bookmarking/unbookmarking resources

**Thoughts:**
- I get nervous about making a big change to a more complex app and sort of just don't want to start. Trying out some things and successfully debugging issues with my jQuery on a simpler app was confidence-boosting and good practice.

### Day 21: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed a Codewars challenge in Ruby
- Did some more research on (potentially) using jQuery to implement the improved bookmark functionality on my personal project.

**Thoughts:**
- Coding later in the day meant that my commit streak on Github is broken due to the UTC timestamps. :( The blank space is going to bother me.
- Taking a step back and looking at AJAX calls in Rails with some resources made the prospect of implementing it a bit less scary than yesterday.

### Day 20: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting section on FreeCodeCamp!
- Made a small step toward improving the user experience on my personal project and started documenting my progress for a future blog post.

**Thoughts:**
- I feel much more at home with ES6 syntax now.
- The prospect of using jQuery for my personal project (it's one option I'm considering moving forward with) is frightening. I struggled with jQuery the most in my bootcamp, so I know it'll be good practice but... I also just don't like it. More exploration on that to come tomorrow, though.

1. [JavaScript challenges (some were completed for my bootcamp, some on FCC)](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript)


### Day 19: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Basic Data Structures and started Basic Algorithm Scripting on FreeCodeCamp
- Returned to a personal project I haven't worked on in a while. My goal for improving the project is to smooth out the user experience with adding bookmarks - I'd ideally like to learn enough to eliminate page refreshes altogether when a user adds or removes a bookmark using a button.

**Thoughts:**
- JS syntax is making a lot more sense to me - I appreciate how the Data Structures and Basic Algorithms sections on FreeCodeCamp build off of one another in order to support more independence in students.
- Going back to an old project is a rude awakening - I forgot a lot about what I wrote a while back, so I've had to refamiliarize myself with the code while also researching how to improve it.

### Day 18: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Basic Data Structures on FreeCodeCamp and started working through the Basic Algorithm Scripting section.

**Thoughts:**
- The Basic Data Structures section helped me take a step back and think about looking at JSON  differently, while also helping me see how concepts I'm familiar with in Ruby are applied in JavaScript
- The Basic Algorithm Scripting section contains challenges I've completed in both JS and Ruby, so it was just some good review and practice with JS syntax.

### Day 17: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked through several debugging JS lessons on FreeCodeCamp.
- It had been a while since I'd done any Ruby coding challenges, so I did a couple from Codewars.

**Thoughts:**
- I really need to make Ruby challenges a standard part of my daily routine - both to keep my Ruby skills sharp and maybe even apply some things I just learned, like regular expressions.

2. [Multiplication Table Solution](https://github.com/amyhenning/coding-challenges/blob/master/multiplication_table.rb)

### Day 16: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Practiced a bunch with regular expressions: redid the FreeCodeCamp exercises and took notes this time, then began interactive lessons on regexone.com

**Thoughts:**
- I really do need to take notes more often - this helped a lot with remembering regex syntax.

**Link to Work:**
1. None for today!

### Day 15: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Refactored flickr-stream partial to use image_tags in link_to tags.
- Completed lots of JS exercises (ES6 and regex) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**
- I am looking forward to getting used to JS's syntax. Right now, it still hurts my eyes.
- Regular expressions are still largely inscrutable to me. I am planning to redo the regex section on FreeCodeCamp and take careful, color-coded notes by hand. Maybe after that I'll study up on regex syntax in Ruby and make a comparison guide to really solidify the concepts and syntax in both languages.

1. [Practice with ES6 arrow functions](https://github.com/amyhenning/javascript/blob/master/squaredIntegers.js)

### Day 14: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Took some strategic steps to figure out how to handle errors from the Flickr API on my flickr-stream app. First, figured out how to render a json error if the API returned "user not found." Then moved on to separating the views into partials to render based on the API's response.

**Thoughts:**
- Lots of Googling and learning from how others have structured similar apps today.
- Building this app was great practice doing a self-guided project with unfamiliar territory: Flickr's API, handling errors, and practicing with partial views.

### Day 13: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Used the magic of irb to test FlickRaw responses and determine how to get the params I wanted to use in the Flickr Stream app's views.

**Thoughts:**
- Spending some time thinking through this through the lens of writing the API client helped me figure out what I wanted to do and how to get the information I needed.
- Up next is adding error messages when a user doesn't exist.

### Day 12: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Realized my dates from the last two logs were wrong. Woops. Fixed that.
- Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to use the Flickraw gem in my flickr-stream project. As of now, it seems to be working to return photos from the Flickr API, but I still need to figure out how to get different properties of each photo, such as its URL.

**Thoughts:**
- For some reason, I had a hard time understanding the documentation for the Flickraw gem - this made my progress slower than anticipated today.
- More Ruby exercises needed in the future.

### Day 11: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished all Basic JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
- Made some small progress on my flickr-stream app.

**Thoughts:**
- JavaScript makes me yearn for the simplicity of Ruby syntax!
- I enjoyed learning about switch statements a lot, and the Basic JS exercises were a good refresh and a good intro to several things that my bootcamp didn't cover and that I've never encountered in my own projects.
- I need to spend more time solving algorithms!

**Link to Work:**
1. None today!

### Day 10: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed many simple JS exercises on FreeCodeCamp to get a firmer grasp on its formatting
- Started another more complex Rails API project via the Odin Project

**Thoughts:**
- It's not that I can't or don't want to learn JavaScript... I just am less exposed to it than other languages. I also far prefer Ruby's clean formatting. However, I recognize the incredible value of JS and am determined to get a better grasp on it.
- Considering making the new API project more complex than written in The Odin Project's lesson by not using a Gem. We'll see how that goes.

**Link to Work:**
- None today!

### Day 9: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Re-read the "APIs and Building Your Own" section of The Odin Project.
- Finished the simple RESTful API I started yesterday.

**Thoughts:**
- APIs are making a lot more sense now! Spending time reading about and working with them in various forms has been super helpful for my learning.

**Link to Work:**
1. [Live Kittens! Site](http://kittens-amy-henning.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 8: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started the "APIs and Building Your Own" section of The Odin Project.
- Created initial structure for the simple Kittens RESTful API in the curriculum.

**Thoughts:**
- I'm enjoying the write-ups from the Odin Project's curriculum so far. It's interesting to delve into new curricula and pick and choose what I'm looking for, and this one is structured in such a way that that's both possible and easy.
- I'm excited to learn from this project but also want to revisit yesterday's simple gem to see if I can expand its functionality without the tutorial.

### Day 7: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Spent a _long_ time searching for a good, simple tutorial on creating an API client that wasn't just a simple Rails CRUD app.
- Found some great resources on GoRails.com!
- Followed [this tutorial](https://gorails.com/episodes/consuming-an-api-using-httparty-and-creating-a-gem) to build a simple Ruby Gem to interact with [Animatedgif.me](http://animatedgif.me)

**Thoughts:**
- The video tutorial was well-explained and concise. I had to do some debugging that I assume had something to do with the tutorial being over 4 years old, but all worked out fine in the end and the debugging was a good learning exercise, anyway.
- I can now say that I've created a simple Ruby gem. :)
- Still on the hunt for a good tutorial that walks you through creating an API client with authentication, though.

### Day 6: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Continued working on backend Rails project.

**Thoughts:**
- There's a lot I don't know, and even more that I don't know I don't know. While I thought building a simple API from scratch would be no problem, it's proving very challenging because I haven't built one with any guidance before. I want to improve at this, and I learn best by doing, so I may create one following a tutorial first, then move toward building my own after I understand a basic structure and approach.

### Day 5: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started and finished a quick portfolio page using flexbox. Didn't add in all the content I would have wanted, but the process gave me some design ideas for updating my existing portfolio site.

**Thoughts:**
- Simple design projects like this one are going faster with more and more practice. It's great to know that I'm solidifying and improving existing skills!

### Day 4: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started working on a backend Rails project.
- Solved a coding challenge to turn a string of numbers into an integer without using Ruby's `to_i` method.

**Thoughts:**
- Feel like I'm stumbling around in the dark with the Rails project, which is a definite change from the front-end work I've been doing lately. But it's a great challenge and I love learning about the logic of backend things and want to learn more about creating API clients.
- I need to dig deeper into the `inject`/`reduce` methods in Ruby. I have found them quite useful in the past but still don't fully understand how they work.

### Day 3: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Started and finished a responsive technical documentation page project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Before I started on this, the finished product looked more complicated than it actually turned out to be. Yay for learning!
- Using some of the RuboCop Ruby Style Guide to populate content for this product was also a learning experience for me in some Ruby styling conventions.

1. [Basic Ruby Styles](https://codepen.io/amyhenning/pen/maGwRb)

### Day 2: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Double-checked that projects from yesterday were passing all tests, and made some small adjustments to get them there
- Started and finished the product landing page project from FreeCodeCamp (made it into a mockup for the front-end of a future project I'm planning on working on)

**Thoughts:**
- Getting more and more practice with flexbox and media queries has been great.
- While I've known how to work with CSS since high school, going through these exercises is helping it seem less overwhelming and helping me organize my code more efficiently.

### Day 1: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed the simple tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp
- Completed survey form project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:**
- Both these projects were in essence very simple tasks, yet they were an opportunity to apply some concepts I've picked up through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum - including accessibility and flexbox.
- Both projects were great in pushing me to move away from depending on Bootstrap to make design responsive!
