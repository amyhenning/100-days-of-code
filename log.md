# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**
- Double-checked that projects from yesterday were passing all tests, and made some small adjustments to get them there
- Started and finished the product landing page project from FreeCodeCamp (made it into a mockup for the front-end of a future project I'm planning on working on)

**Thoughts**
- Getting more and more practice with flexbox and media queries has been great.
- While I've known how to work with CSS since high school, going through these exercises is helping it seem less overwhelming and helping me organize my code more efficiently.

### Day 1: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed the simple tribute page project from FreeCodeCamp
- Completed survey form project from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** 
- Both these projects were in essence very simple tasks, yet they were an opportunity to apply some concepts I've picked up through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum - including accessibility and flexbox.
- Both projects were great in pushing me to move away from depending on Bootstrap to make design responsive!
